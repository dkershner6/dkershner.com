# Solutions Architect Handbook

by Saurabh Shrivastava (Author), Neelanjali Srivastav (Author), Kamal Arora (Foreword)

Kick-start your solutions architect career by learning architecture design principles and strategies

## TLDR

-   This explores the world of Software Architecture through a bit narrower lens, making use of AWS as a backdrop for patterns and strategies. This makes the information a bit more real-world usable.
-   If you only read one of this book or Software Architect's Handbook, do the other one. It can be worth reading both, though there is definite duplication.
-   This is more or less a training of how to become a Solutions Architect, which is a newer name for a Software Architect who doesn't code in large organizations. This is unlikely to ever be us.

## Why?

I read this when trying to get my hands on as much Architecture knowledge as was available. I'd prioritize this lower on the list than most, but its a decent read.

## Who should read?

Those interested in becoming advanced Architects (and probably only them, and has read Software Architect's Handbook)

## Important Concepts

-   Applying architecture design patterns with actual pieces of infrastructure (AWS) is helpful to see concepts in the way you would in real life.
