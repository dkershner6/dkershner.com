# I Heart Logs

by Jay Kreps

Event Stream Processing and Data Integration

## TLDR

-   This book is short, and a very quick read. Like, so short it hardly needs a TLDR, just read it.
-   Don't take "Logs" too literally, it really refers to "Events".
-   This is a journey into centralized event processing, a story about LinkedIn creating Apache Kafka (and more importantly, why)

## Why?

Event-driven architectures are likely going to drive the future of architecture design, at least in the intermediate term. Centralizing has advantages, and this book dives deep into them.

## Who should read?

If you have interest in why things like Eventbridge, Kafka, or even SNS (pub/sub) exist, and want an in depth analysis, this book is for you.

## Important Concepts

-   Pay a lot of attention to the pain points he faces, and how he solves them, more than paying attention to the specifics of Kafka.
