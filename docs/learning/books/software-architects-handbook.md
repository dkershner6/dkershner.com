# Software Architect's Handbook

by Joseph Ingeno

A comprehensive guide to exploring software architecture concepts and implementing best practices

## TLDR

-   Provides architecture patterns similar to the Gang of Four Design Patterns for Code. The fact is that the architecture patterns are a little less resuable and a little broader, however, so it isn't a no-brainer to learn.
-   If you are diving deep into Architecture, this book is worthy of both reading, and to have on hand as a reference.
-   It also semi-serves as a mini definition of "What is a Software Architect (and how does it fit in a business)"

## Why?

If you have a keen interest in Software Architecture, it's nice to have a dictionary.

## Who should read?

Those interested in becoming advanced Architects (and probably only them)

## Important Concepts

-   DevOps is discussed, not at length, but it gives a good feel for how it would work in a larger organization
-   As per usual, the soft-skills, and communication sections are likely of the highest value.
-   The patterns themselves are worth looking over, but then revisiting as you are looking at something in the real world.
