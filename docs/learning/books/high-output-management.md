# High Output Management

by Andrew S. Grove (ex-CEO of Intel)

Note: This book is non-programming specific, about general management

## TLDR

-   This book is/was commonly given to Silicon Valley startup CEOs. While I may choose other books for that specific role, I can see why this one was chosen. It covers many, very broad topics and does a good job with analogies (so long as you ignore their outdated subjects).
-   This book places a heavy emphasis on performance reviews, giving them utmost importance, and talking deeply about what they should contain, and does a good job doing so.
-   Concepts like leverage, task-relevant maturity, and difficult conversations are particularly well done and valuable.

## Why?

This book talks through the specifics of management at the highest levels, but gets there by steadily moving up levels of complexity. This, combined with solid analogies, paints a simple to understand picture and gives direction of where to head.

## Who should read?

I would say anyone could read this, but I would call this required reading for anyone interested in the management path. You should read The Manager's Path first, but this is a solid learning tool and covers totally different topics.

## Important concepts

-   CUA Factor: Complexity, Uncertainty, Ambiguity - The levels of these should guide how you manage. (Chapter 10)
-   Task-Relevant Maturity: The level of experience the subordinate has is a fundamental determiner of proper management style. (Chapter 12)
-   Performance Appraisal: This is covered throughout the book, but the particulars of how to deliver and the purpose are covered deeply in Chapter 13.
