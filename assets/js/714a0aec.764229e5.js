It is definitely written from a pro-microservices standpoint, but refrains from being preachy.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/building-microservices"},{"id":"learning/books/design-patterns","title":"Design Patterns","description":"For every issue you encounter in code, you are likely implementing one of these patterns, but this book gives it a name, and you awareness of that fact.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/design-patterns"},{"id":"learning/books/high-output-management","title":"High Output Management","description":"This book talks through the specifics of management at the highest levels, but gets there by steadily moving up levels of complexity. This, combined with solid analogies, paints a simple to understand picture and gives direction of where to head.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/high-output-management"},{"id":"learning/books/i-heart-logs","title":"I Heart Logs","description":"Event-driven architectures are likely going to drive the future of architecture design, at least in the intermediate term.
