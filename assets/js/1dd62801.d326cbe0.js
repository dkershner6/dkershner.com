Any time you can find that window, open it.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/clean-coder"},{"id":"learning/books/conscious-business","title":"Conscious Business","description":"This book is completely different from other management books, but also seemingly the same. It builds on concepts you definitely know, simple ones, but presents them in an easy-to-follow and highly tactical fashion, one at a time, then brings it all together into one simple but powerful package.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/conscious-business"},{"id":"learning/books/dare-to-lead","title":"Dare to Lead","description":"This book is my favorite management book to date. Perhaps it is just me, but this book spoke to me in greater fashion than others.  Others had situations that felt familiar, but not exact.  This book felt dead on 100% of the time, which made it all the more powerful.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/dare-to-lead"},{"id":"learning/books/engineering-leadership-interviews","title":"Engineering Leadership Interviews","description":"I am not sure I really recommend this book, but for someone who asks the exact above question (\\"What do other people experience when managing software people?\\"), it would be hard to beat just a ton of interviews in a book, which this is.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/engineering-leadership-interviews"},{"id":"learning/books/high-output-management","title":"High Output Management","description":"This book talks through the specifics of management at the highest levels, but gets there by steadily moving up levels of complexity. This, combined with solid analogies, paints a simple to understand picture and gives direction of where to head.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/high-output-management"},{"id":"learning/books/kanban-and-scrum","title":"Kanban and Scrum","description":"by Henrik Kniberg (Author), Mattias Skarin (Contributor)","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/kanban-and-scrum"},{"id":"learning/books/leading-out-loud","title":"Leading Out Loud","description":"This book focuses near entirely on communcation: Authentic, vulnerable communcation and exactly how to achieve it","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/leading-out-loud"},{"id":"learning/books/managing-humans","title":"Managing Humans","description":"This book is a good summary of all of the possible situations you will encounter as a Software Engineering Manager, and contains tidbits of how best to handle each.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/managing-humans"},{"id":"learning/books/managing-the-unmanageable","title":"Managing Humans","description":"This book approaches Software Management from a different perspective from the others, looking at it more from the perspective of incremental improvement rather than high-level strategies. Both are very helpful.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/managing-the-unmanageable"},{"id":"learning/books/radical-candor","title":"Radical Candor","description":"This book provides what in some organizations may be a radical idea: actually saying what you think.
