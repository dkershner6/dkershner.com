Perhaps it is just me, but this book spoke to me in greater fashion than others.  Others had situations that felt familiar, but not exact.  This book felt dead on 100% of the time, which made it all the more powerful.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/dare-to-lead"},{"id":"learning/books/high-output-management","title":"High Output Management","description":"This book talks through the specifics of management at the highest levels, but gets there by steadily moving up levels of complexity.
