It is definitely written from a pro-microservices standpoint, but refrains from being preachy.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/building-microservices"},{"id":"learning/books/clean-code","title":"Clean Code","description":"by Robert C. Martin","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/clean-code"},{"id":"learning/books/clean-coder","title":"Clean Coder","description":"This book is a window to a future you, wisened by years or decades of experience. Any time you can find that window, open it.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/clean-coder"},{"id":"learning/books/conscious-business","title":"Conscious Business","description":"This book is completely different from other management books, but also seemingly the same. It builds on concepts you definitely know, simple ones, but presents them in an easy-to-follow and highly tactical fashion, one at a time, then brings it all together into one simple but powerful package.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/conscious-business"},{"id":"learning/books/dare-to-lead","title":"Dare to Lead","description":"This book is my favorite management book to date. Perhaps it is just me, but this book spoke to me in greater fashion than others.  Others had situations that felt familiar, but not exact.  This book felt dead on 100% of the time, which made it all the more powerful.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/dare-to-lead"},{"id":"learning/books/design-patterns","title":"Design Patterns","description":"For every issue you encounter in code, you are likely implementing one of these patterns, but this book gives it a name, and you awareness of that fact.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/design-patterns"},{"id":"learning/books/engineering-leadership-interviews","title":"Engineering Leadership Interviews","description":"I am not sure I really recommend this book, but for someone who asks the exact above question (\\"What do other people experience when managing software people?\\"), it would be hard to beat just a ton of interviews in a book, which this is.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/engineering-leadership-interviews"},{"id":"learning/books/high-output-management","title":"High Output Management","description":"This book talks through the specifics of management at the highest levels, but gets there by steadily moving up levels of complexity. This, combined with solid analogies, paints a simple to understand picture and gives direction of where to head.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/high-output-management"},{"id":"learning/books/i-heart-logs","title":"I Heart Logs","description":"Event-driven architectures are likely going to drive the future of architecture design, at least in the intermediate term.

Both are very helpful.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/managing-the-unmanageable"},{"id":"learning/books/programming-pearls","title":"Programming Pearls","description":"If you have an interest in being the best coder you can be, you have to have familiarity with algorithms. This is the best introduction to why that is that I have found.","permalink":"/resources/learning/books/programming-pearls"},{"id":"learning/books/radical-candor","title":"Radical Candor","description":"This book provides what in some organizations may be a radical idea: actually saying what you think.
